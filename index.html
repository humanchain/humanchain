Scope
        <br>
Blockchain is a revolutionary technology,which is promoting us to rethink  about existing business models or even corporate stereotypes. However, such decentralized thinking of commercial appliances are assumed to interact and invite more audience and practioners who might seek more transparency and trust in their financial terms. Hence, it becomes prominent solution in humanitarian aid management, disaster resilience,where bio-metric identity and border management are conceptualized in a decentralized form to track crisis situation. Thus, we are highly motivated in meeting a current demand with workshop about blockchain and its  necessity in disaster moments. 
Our workshop will be intersection of research trends of 'Blockchain communication' and 'humanitarian communication during disaster'. Authors of industry and academia will collaborate, discuss and present emerging communication paradigms from both domains. Hence, the scope of the workshop is as follows
